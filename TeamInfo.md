## Project Summary
As the world's leading video-sharing platform, YouTube generates vast amounts of data everyday. These trend data, such as trending date, likes, view count, are valuable resources for understanding user preferences and developing website functionalities. However, with millions of videos uploading to YouTube everyday, it becomes harder and harder for users to select videos that they would like to watch. To solve this problem, YouTube creates a functionality called “Trending” that collects some of the most popular videos across different categories with special formula.  However, this functionality has its own drawbacks. For example, users are not able to find out the trending videos for a specific category or region. To enhance the experience of watching YouTube videos, our group decided to create a project called “YouTube Best Collection” that makes further categorization based on the selected trending videos. 
 In our project, we will implement functionalities like sorting, filtering, and basic searching to our webpage. Our primary goal is to improve users’ watching experience, convenience, and spread high-quality videos. Also, through these implements, we will be able to create weekly recommendations based on preferences of users.
