# YouTube Best Collection - Team083 EdgeRunners

The team project of CS 411 for Team 083

### Introduction

As the world's leading video-sharing platform, YouTube generates vast amounts of data every day. These trend data, such as trending date, likes, and view count, are valuable resources for understanding user preferences and developing website functionalities. However, with millions of videos uploaded to YouTube every day, it becomes harder and harder for users to select videos that they would like to watch. To solve this problem, YouTube created a functionality called “Trending” that collects some of the most popular videos across different categories with a special formula. However, this functionality has its own drawbacks. For example, users cannot find trending videos for a specific category or region. To enhance the experience of watching YouTube videos, our group decided to create a project called “YouTube Best Collection” that makes further categorization based on the selected trending videos.

In our project, we will implement functionalities like sorting, filtering, and basic searching on our webpage. Our primary goal is to improve users’ watching experience and convenience, and spread high-quality videos. Also, through these implements, we will be able to create weekly recommendations based on the preferences of users.

The front-end is implemented with JavaScript and React, the back-end is implemented with Python, and the database is implemented with MySQL.
